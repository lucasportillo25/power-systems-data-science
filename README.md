# Power Systems Data Science

## Professional Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of engineering and data science projects focused on **electrical power systems**, **mathematical modeling**, and **data-driven analysis** applied to energy systems.

The objective is to demonstrate end-to-end technical capability, from physical modeling and numerical methods to modern data science and machine learning, with a strong emphasis on reproducibility and engineering rigor.
