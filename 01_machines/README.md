# Synchronous Machines – Physics-Based Modeling and Machine Learning

This module focuses on the **steady-state modeling of synchronous machines** and the integration of classical electrical engineering theory with **data-driven and machine learning techniques**.

The objective is to demonstrate how physical models of electrical machines can be translated into computational simulations, used to generate datasets, and later approximated by surrogate machine learning models for power system studies.

## 1. Physical Model

The synchronous machine is modeled in steady state using per-unit quantities. The formulation is based on classical power system theory and captures the fundamental relationships between:

* Terminal voltage magnitude (V)
* Internal electromotive force (E)
* Load angle (δ)

From these variables, the model computes:

* Active power output (P)
* Reactive power output (Q)
* Stator current magnitude (I)

The implementation prioritizes **clarity, mathematical consistency, and reusability**, making it suitable both for educational purposes and for integration into larger power system simulations.

**File:**

* `synchronous_machine_model.py`

## 2. Dataset Generation

Using the physical model, a synthetic dataset is generated by sweeping realistic operating ranges of:

* Terminal voltage
* Internal emf
* Load angle

Each operating point produces a labeled data sample that maps machine operating conditions to electrical outputs.

This dataset is intended for:

* regression problems
* sensitivity analysis
* benchmarking machine learning models in power systems
* building surrogate models for fast simulations

**File:**

* `generate_synchronous_machine_dataset.py`

**Output:**

* `synchronous_machine_dataset.csv`

## 3. Machine Learning Regression Model

A first set of machine learning models is trained to approximate the synchronous machine behavior using the generated dataset.

The workflow includes:

* feature selection (V, E, δ)
* train–test split
* feature scaling
* model training and evaluation

Baseline regression models are used intentionally to:

* establish reference performance
* maintain interpretability
* highlight the relationship between physics-based and data-driven models

Evaluation metrics:

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Coefficient of Determination (R²)

**File:**

* `ml_regression_synchronous_machine.py`
